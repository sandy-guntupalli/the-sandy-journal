  <h1> Todays Hot Topic </h1>
    <h2> What is the best Harry Potter movie? </h2>
  <img scr="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/bb/17/e2/bb17e20249d1d831eba9cd9f21cbc496.jpg" </img>

<p> This may be controversial, but I think the Order of the Phoenix is the best movie out of all the Harry Potter series. I have a list of reasons why, first: we get to see multiple genres within this movie as it utilizes romance, suspense, adventure, and comedy. The next reason is that it introduces a solution for the problem of Voldemort instilling hope to viewers which is good because it makes the experience of the movie better. The third reason is that Harry is painted as a more leader sort of character by teaching his friends spells that would be useful to defend themselves. My favorite scene is where Harry and his friends face Voldemort's death eaters chase them and then Strange and his troop appear and fight them. I love this movie the most because it uses all the elements I want in any movie and still managed to display a continuation of the series. </p>

<h1> The Favs of the Week </h1>
<h2> Movie: Ratatouille </h2>

<p> What can I say? Ratatouille is one of the best movies ever created! Everything about it is amazing, the message, the characters, and the food. This movie will forever be in my heart as Remy is so inspirational: Anyone can be a cook! 👩‍🍳  </p>
  
<h2> Movie 2: Howl's Moving Castle </h2>

<p> Every Ghbili film ever made will be legendary, and I mean EVERY SINGLE ONE. Howl's Moving Castle has an enchanting plot and the moment you start to watch, you can't stop; plus, the animation style is SO GOOD. It also has a good amount of humor, making it an all around delightful screening. </p>
  
<h2> Art: Frog Mug </h2>

<p> I mean who wouldn't want a frog mug. IDK how I got into frogs, but all I know is that they rock. The mug also looks really sturdy and would be able to last a good amount of time, I will be purchasing it and you should too (if you are looking to spend your money for no reason 😀). Here is a link for where you can buy the frog mug: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toby-Toad-Frog-Coffee-Adorable/dp/B000M67DUW/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=frog+mug&qid=1601834685&sr=8-5">Frog Mug</a> </p>

<p> I chose this song because IDK it is really different from other music I listen to and it sounds very good. The song is by the bird and bees and they are becoming one my favorite bands. So, if you wanna listen to cool, fresh, new, song, check it out 😆🤝😛. </p>
